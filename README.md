### Similarity and Distance Quantification between Probability Functions

> Describe and understand the world through data.

Data collection and data comparison are the foundations of scientific research.
This scientific method allows us to infer natural patterns and enables us to
understand the world around us. _Mathematics_ provides the abstract framework to encode the patterns we learned from nature and _Statistics_ provides the
framework to quantify the uncertainty of these patterns. In statistics natural patterns
are described in form of probability distributions which either follow a fixed pattern (parametric distributions) or more dynamic patterns (non-parametric distributions).

The `philentropy` package implements fundamental distance and similarity measures to quantify distances between probability density functions. In this regard, it aims to provide a framework for comparing
natural patterns in a statistical notation.  

This project is born out of my passion for statistics and I hope that it will be useful to
the people who share it with me.

### Installation

```r
# install.packages("devtools")

# install the current version of philentropy on your system
library(devtools)
install_github("HajkD/philentropy", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

# On Windows, this won't work - see ?build_github_devtools
install_github("HajkD/philentropy", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

# When working with Windows, first you need to install the
# R package: rtools -> install.packages("rtools")

# Afterwards you can install devtools -> install.packages("devtools")
# and then you can run:

devtools::install_github("HajkD/philentropy", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

# and then call it from the library
library("philentropy", lib.loc = "C:/Program Files/R/R-3.1.1/library")

```
